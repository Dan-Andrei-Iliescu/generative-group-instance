### Evaluation

- [ ] I should display results as violin plots instead of tables, in order to show the distribution of scores visually.
- [ ] I should change the evaluation procedure to the one in [Bouchacourt2018Multilevel](https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1209557). Thus, predict the ground-truth group factor from the group and instance latents. The error should be low for the former and high for the latter.
- [ ] (If I have time) I should run a comparison on standard image disentanglement datasets (e.g. dSprites, MPI3D, etc).
